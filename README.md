# GameEngine
I created a game engine from scratch for school using SLD2.
This engine was used to create a clone of the tank mini-game from the original TRON arcade game, which I made as a project for school.

# Controls:
WASD to move
Move the mouse to rotate the turret
Space or Left Mouse Button to shoot
